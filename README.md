#My thoughts:
I prefered to follow the specs from the wires, even if at some point those were a bit superficial, perhaps for exercising purposes. Anyway, from a visual perspective, I tried to keep it simple and clear, therefore you can find a slightly flavour of skyblue color on navigation, CTA button, links and footer, with some hover and transition effects for an effective customer experience. 
Also I touched all channels, meaning that the website should scale properly on any device (hopefully) and on any screen size. The goal was to have a coherent and seamless experience, doesn't matter from where the website is accessed.
